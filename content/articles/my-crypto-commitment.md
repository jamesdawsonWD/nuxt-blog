I’m a college dropout. In 2012, I started studying Computer Science at the University of Stirling in Scotland. A year before, I discovered my love for building websites at 17, but with A levels in Music, Geography, and Business Studies, I thought Computer Science was out of reach. My A-level results (A*, C, C) weren’t exceptional, but at the last minute, I found a university that accepted me into a Computer Science program.

University life was a mix of partying, getting stoned, and coasting through classes. Instead of studying, I spent countless late nights building websites and cramming my tests and workshops into last minute sprints. Eventually, the final year project—a task that required long-term dedication—became too much for me. I crumbled under the pressure and dropped out. It felt like I had ruined my life.

Determined to learn from my lessons, I quit smoking weed, focused on self-learning, and landed my first software job. Seven years later, my skill and passion for programming is stronger than ever. After years of building websites, I now want to specialize in something I truly believe in: the Ethereum blockchain. I believe a fair and decentralized finacial system is imperative for humanity. I want to bring my ideas and beliefs to the table and that is why I have decided to begin a course on cryptography and blockchain.

Returning to university isn’t practical for me—financially or otherwise. (I am soon going to be a father) Fortunately, with the power of AI, I believe there’s never been a better opportunity to be a self-starter. Below, I’ve asked ChatGPT to generate a syllabus on cryptography and blockchain with a focus on Ethereum. This will be my roadmap over the next 1-2 years. Every study session and workshop will be documented as proof of my progress. In two years, I hope to have the equivalent knowledge of a master’s degree from Stanford, Harvard, Oxford, or Cambridge—entirely self-taught through AI.

If you have any suggestions over what I am missing in this. Please email me at the bottom of this article. Wish me the best!
